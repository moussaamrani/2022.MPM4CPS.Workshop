Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

Would you join MPM4CPS as a PC Member?

For the third time, we are organising the MPM4CPS (Multi-Paradigm Modelling for
Cyber-Physical Systems) Workshop, which will be co-located with MoDELS 2021.

Besides the regular paper formats (short, long, and "lightning talks"), we have
two special kinds of submission this year:

- contributing with an Exemplar of a CPS that is effectively modelled through an
MPM approach (meaning with a mix of multi-formalisms, multi-abstractions, multi-
view, etc.);

- contributing with a description of a particular process for MPM design,
deployement, maintenance, etc. in the form of an FTG+PM.

We expect to ask you to review one regular paper max, with eventually one paper
belonging to the special kinds. Based on the previous submission number and the
(expected) size of the PC, we will keep this number minimal.

Please note that the review process will likely take place during the three
weeks before the 15th of August.

If you cannot join, would you kindly refer us to some of your colleagues that
would be able to join?

Have a nice day!

Best regards,

Moussa Amrani,
on behalf of the MPM4CPS Organising Committee
